*DESCRIPTION*:
Here, i developed a Weather Data Dashboard in Python that integrates real‑time and forecasted data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The project focused on building a resilient application that could fetch forecast data and, if unavailable, automatically fall back to current weather information. This taught me the importance of error handling and designing systems that adapt gracefully.

I transformed raw JSON responses into structured Pandas DataFrames, handling both forecast lists and single current weather records. This step allowed efficient data wrangling and prepared the dataset for visualization. I gained strong experience in cleaning, structuring, and managing data pipelines.

For visualization, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:

1.Line charts showing temperature trends.

2.Dual‑axis plots combining temperature, “feels like,” and humidity.

3.Boxplots for daily temperature distributions.

4.Bar charts summarizing current weather metrics.

I GAVE AN EXAMPLE WEATHER FORECAST ON MUMBAI IF YOU WANNA CHANGE YOU  CAN ALSO I KEPT THE WEATHE API ACTIVE SO NO ISSUES CIN ACTIVATION  

Key skills I applied and strengthened are,

1.API integration and request handling.

2.Data wrangling with Pandas.

3.Visualization techniques with Matplotlib/Seaborn.

so i used and executed in python "IDLE "
THANK YOU
